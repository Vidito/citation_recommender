The linguistic analysis of writing systems at various levels (e.g. orthography, punctuation, typography), including comparative WS research. 2. The learning and use of writing systems, including: Learning to read and write in children (normal and disabled children, bilingual children acquiring two WSs, deaf children) and adults (illiterates, learners of second language WSs). The psycholinguistic processes of reading (grapheme recognition, word recognition) and writing (spelling, handwriting) in specific writing systems and in cross-orthographic comparisons. 3. Neurolinguistics and writing systems (e.g., lateralisation, reading pathologies, reading and writing disorders). 4. The correlates of writing systems: Writing systems and metalinguistic awareness (e.g., phonemic awareness, word awareness). Cognitive consequences of writing systems (e.g., visual memory, representations of time sequences). 5. Writing systems and computer/new media: Computers in reading and writing. Consequences of computers/new media on writing systems and their use. Computer modelling of writing systems.",
